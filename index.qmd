## About Me

I am a third-year graduate student in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://statistics.artsandsciences.baylor.edu) at [Baylor University](https://www.baylor.edu). I moved to Waco after completing my undergraduate studies at [Wheaton College](https://www.wheaton.edu), where I played baseball for the Thunder. I proudly hail from Phoenix and will spend every second I can visiting northern Arizona.

Generally speaking, you can find me at [Grace Church Waco](https://gracewaco.com) on a given Sunday morning, and I'm always trying to find a way to go back to the Czech Republic to work with [Křesťanská Akademie Mladých](https://kam.cz) again.

Currently, I am learning many new statistical methods that will enable me to build predictive models, understand stochastic phenomena, and discover associations in our world.
