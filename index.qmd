## About Me

I am a third-year graduate student in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://statistics.artsandsciences.baylor.edu) at [Baylor University](https://www.baylor.edu). I moved to Waco after completing my undergraduate studies at [Wheaton College](https://www.wheaton.edu), where I played baseball for the Thunder. I proudly hail from Phoenix and will spend every second I can visiting northern Arizona.

Generally speaking, you can find me at [Grace Church Waco](https://gracewaco.com) on a given Sunday morning, and I'm always trying to find a way to go back to the Czech Republic to work with [Křesťanská Akademie Mladých](https://kam.cz) again.

Currently, I am learning many new statistical methods that will enable me to build predictive models, understand stochastic phenomena, and discover associations in our world.

**Intern** | KAM (Křesťanská Akademie Mladých)

After support raising for four months, I spent two and a half months working for a youth missions organization in Central and Eastern Europe, called KAM.

I also helped onboard short-term mission teams who joined us for camps.

In this role I met with students 1-on-1 per their request to teach, review, and sharpen their math skills. I met with students ranging in courses from Algebra I to AP Statistics to help them prepare for their exams, whether it’s ones for courses or AP exams.
