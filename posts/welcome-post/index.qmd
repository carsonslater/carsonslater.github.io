## Welcome!

This is the first post on my new blog. I'm excited to share my thoughts, projects, and insights here.

### What to Expect

In future posts, I'll be writing about:

- Statistical methods and data analysis
- R programming and Quarto
- Research projects and findings
- Thoughts on faith, life, and learning

### Getting Started

Creating a new blog post is easy! Just:

1. Create a new directory in the `posts/` folder
2. Add an `index.qmd` file with your content
3. Include YAML frontmatter with title, description, date, and categories
4. Render your site with `quarto preview` or `quarto render`

Stay tuned for more content!
