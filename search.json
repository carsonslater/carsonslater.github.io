For this work I lived in Ostrava, CZ where I assisted local CB churches with youth outreach through camps where I taught English and sports. I also helped onboard short-term mission teams who joined us for camps.\nAcademic Coach | Wheaton Academy Jan 2023 - May 2023\nIn this role I met with students 1-on-1 per their request to teach, review, and sharpen their math skills. I met with students ranging in courses from Algebra I to AP Statistics to help them prepare for their exams, whether it’s ones for courses or AP exams.\nTeaching Assistant | Wheaton College Aug 2022 - May 2023\nI was the teaching assistant for Dr. Peter Jantsch in the fall of 2022 and spring of 2023. I hosted weekly help sessions for students to come in for extra help, and graded course homework. The courses I helped with were: - MATH 465: Applied Machine Learning - MATH 363: Probability Theory"
