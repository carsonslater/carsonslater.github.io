        <p class="title">About </p>
        <p>Howdy! I am a senior at Wheaton College (IL) studying Mathematics and Economics. I am hoping to pursue a Ph.D in Statistics and Biostatistcs. I am really interested in machine mearning algorithms and their applications. I believe statistics is a powerful tool that can be wielded for good, but can also cause harm. I hope to use statistics as a means to love and serve my neighbor.</p>
